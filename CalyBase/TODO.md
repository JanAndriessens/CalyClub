  - Fixed npm dependency issues and permissions
  - Built TypeScript to JavaScript successfully
  - Deployed to `https://us-central1-calyclub.cloudfunctions.net/api`
  - Verified API endpoints responding correctly

### 📋 Technical Implementation Details:

#### **Files Modified:**
1. **`functions/src/index.ts`** - CORS configuration and TypeScript fixes
   - Updated `allowedOrigins` array with Vercel domains (lines 23-31)
   - Fixed error handling type safety (line 99-100)
   - Added proper TypeScript annotations for request handlers

#### **Key CORS Settings:**
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://calyclub.web.app',
  'https://calyclub.firebaseapp.com', 
  'https://calyclub.vercel.app',        // Added for production
  'https://caly-base.vercel.app',       // Added for production
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:3001',
  'http://localhost:5000'
];
```

#### **Deployment Process:**
1. Fixed npm cache permissions with `sudo chown`
2. Installed Firebase Functions dependencies with `npm install`
3. Resolved TypeScript compilation errors
4. Built functions with `npm run build`
5. Deployed with `firebase deploy --only functions`
6. Verified deployment success and API functionality

### 🎯 **Results:**

#### **✅ User Deletion Functionality Restored:**
