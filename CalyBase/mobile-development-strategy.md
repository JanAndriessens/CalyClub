|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Development Time | 12-20 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Claude Code Feasibility | Partial (40%) | Full (95%) |
| Maintenance | 2 codebases | 1 codebase |
| App Store Fees | €124/year | €0 |
| Update Process | App Store review (days) | Instant |
| User Installation | App Store download | Add to home screen |
| Offline Support | ✓ | ✓ |
| Push Notifications | ✓ | ✓ (Android), Limited (iOS) |

## Architecture Overview

### Current State
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Firebase SDK v8.10.1
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage) + Express.js functions
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting + Vercel (dual deployment)
- **Platform**: Web-only, optimized for Safari/iPad

### Target State (PWA Enhancement)
- **Web App**: Enhanced with PWA capabilities
- **Mobile Experience**: App-like interface on all devices
- **Shared Backend**: Existing Firebase infrastructure
- **Payment System**: Payconiq integration via web
- **Treasury**: Simplified CSV import/export

}
if ('PushManager' in window) {
  // Push notifications available
}
if ('storage' in navigator) {
  // Storage quota management
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Single Codebase Deployment
- **No separate mobile app** - PWA is the web app
- **Instant updates** - Users always get latest version
- **No app stores** - Direct access via URL
- **Progressive rollout** - Feature flags for new capabilities

### PWA Distribution Methods
1. **Direct URL**: calyclub.com
