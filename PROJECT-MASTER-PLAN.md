## Architecture Decisions

### Why PWA Instead of Native App
| Aspect | Native App | PWA (Chosen) |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Development Time | 12-20 weeks | 1-2 weeks âœ… |
| Cost | â‚¬20,000+ | â‚¬0 âœ… |
| Maintenance | 2 codebases | 1 codebase âœ… |
| App Store Fees | â‚¬124/year | â‚¬0 âœ… |
| Updates | Store review | Instant âœ… |
| Offline Support | âœ“ | âœ“ |

### Why Firebase SDK v8

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Vercel 404 Errors
**Solution**: Check vercel.json routing configuration

### Issue: CORS Errors
**Solution**: Add domain to Firebase Functions allowed origins

### Issue: iOS Push Notifications Limited
